No changes were made from part I only added new stuff.
I had javascript from part 1.

This is a list of stuff i added for part 3
Interactive elements (tabs, accordion, lightbox gallery, animated counters)
Leaflet interactive map
Dynamic content loading with search/filter
Full SEO setup (meta tags, structured data, robots.txt, sitemap.xml example)
Fast, secure, mobile-first code
Two fully functional and validated forms (enquiry.html + contact.html) with:HTML5 + JavaScript validation
AJAX submission (using Fetch API)
For contact.html → opens user’s email client with pre-filled email + fallback AJAX to Formspree/example endpoint
js/script.js – Fully functional  Pet filter (All / Dog / Cat) on adopt.html  
Form validation + success pop-ups (all 3 forms)  
Prevent default submission + friendly messages

Minor final enhancements (optional but recommended):Add 6–8 more pet cards (dogs + cats) with proper data-type
Replace <div id="map-placeholder"> with real Google Maps embed


A huge part of making this possible was the addition of a robot.txt and Sitemap.xml file in my POE project.
All Was done on 17th of Novemeber
