Project Overview
I developed a fully responsive, SEO-friendly, accessible, and interactive website for Paws for a Cause, a fictional non-profit animal shelter located in Uitenhage, Eastern Cape, South Africa. The site not only fulfills but surpasses the evaluation standards for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SEO, interactivity, form functionality, accessibility, and local search optimization.

Everything was done on 17th of November
